					Hi all, my name is Ralph I’m a master student in industrial and applied mathematics.
					<br>In my time at this university I have been quite active at study association GEWIS, where I also did a board year, and I have also been active in the career development at the TU/e through MyFuture.
					<br><br>
					This year, I joined the fraction of Groep-één where I’m also the chair since September.
					<br>The past year, I’ve been working a lot on education related matters, which was all very interesting, especially due to the current situation. Now, I want to use our learned lessons to further improve our university, our education and your opportunities to develop yourself in the way you want to!
					<br><br>
					I hope for your trust once again to represent your voice.
					<br>Vote for groep-één December 1st and 2nd!

					Hi everyone. My name is Britt van de Laar and I'm a fourth year built environment student.
					<br><br>Last year I was the commissioner of education of study association CHEOPS. In that year I learned a lot on how the advisory bodies of the TU/e work and what they can get done. I think it is important for students to know that they have a say in our university. Therefore I want to represent you in the university council. 
					<br><br>I have also some experience with the advisory bodies of the TU/e. Due to my function as commissioner of education, I was part of the program committee of the Built Environment (where I am still part of at the moment) and the joint program committee. But even before my board year I was active in the Departmental council of the Built Environment.
					<br><br>With all those experiences. I hope I can contribute to making this university an even better place. And making sure every student finds a place where they can truly be themselves and grow.

					Hello Everybody! My name is Boris Zwaan and I’m in my master’s of Chemical Engineering.
					<br><br>From the beginning of my time as a student, I’ve been busy working for TU/e and their students. I’ve enjoyed several committees at Study Association Japie. Being the chairman of Wervingsdagen last year, I’ve come into contact with all the different studies, study/student associations and university services. Next to that, I’ve worked in several advisory committees, project teams and jobs at TU/e, understanding TU/e’s vision and working culture. 
					<br><br>With these experiences, I want to contribute to TU/e even more via the university council to make TU/e a place where you can develop yourself in a way that suits you in the best possible way. (So that all students can benefit from what TU/e has to give.)
					<br><br>I believe that proper personal leadership/ development and a good balance between challenge based and research based education, in collaboration with the industry, will become the standard at TU/e. TU/e’s community is unique in every sense, already providing a lot of these opportunities for our students and will integrate in TU/e even further in the future. I’m very enthusiastic to advise and help TU/e in executing this task and to make sure all students will benefit from everything TU/e has to give.

				Helloo, My name is Anne and I am currently in the last year of the Bachelor of Industrial Design. 
				<br><br>Last year I did a board year at s.v.i.d. Lucid where I fulfilled the function of commissioner of Education. In that year I had the honor of participating in a lot of different advisory bodies, which let me realize that as a student you can have a big influence in the university. 
				<br><br>I am a creative person and love to come up with solutions no matter what the problem is. So I hope to bring some creativeness to the university council and solve some problems together.

					Hello everyone! I’m Andreas, I come from Greece and I’m in my final year of my bachelor Chemical Engineering. Throughout my years at TU/e (and The Netherlands) I have gained a lot of experience. I have participated in the Introduction week committee of my study association Japie, and last year I did an independent internship at a major multinational company. 
					<br><br>From all the courses that I’ve followed and all the people that I’ve met, either Dutch or international, I have gained a sense of inclusivity and community within me. The international community has a lot to offer to the Dutch one and vise versa! Apart from that, a high quality education and student well-being play a very crucial role in the personal development of each one of us! 
					<br><br>With all of that, I hope to help improve our university through the University Council with Groep-een!

					I am Arne, and I am one of those students that has lots of trouble choosing between all the fun and interesting activities that are around. Therefore I am studying both Industrial Design and Architecture & Urbanism. Apart from that, I have been troubling Team Energy with my ideas and enthusiasm, and am currently doing that for Sustainability Network Eindhoven (SNE, you should check us out, we are doing cool stuff :).
					<br>On behalf of the SNE, I am trying to push for sustainability education for students by students at the TU/e. I have been working with members from Groep Eén, and there I have been impressed by the willingness to make a change.

					Hi everyone, my name is Roxane Wijnen and I am 21 years old.

In my spare time I like hanging out with friends and am I an active member of Thêta.
					<br><br>During my time studying, I have met so many people and my board year allowed me to meet even more. I love the fact that you can know so many people at the TU/e simply because it is relatively small and focuses on the community feeling. That is why I like Groep-één, because they also value community within the TU/e.

I was also part of the student team iGEM 2019 where I learned a lot about personal development in Academics. 
					<br><br>For me, next to the quality of education, the opportunity of experiencing the best student time you can have is what I found the most important. The reason I joined Groep-één is because of inclusivity. We listen to all students who have different ideas and opinions and attempt to include all of it. This creates a place and community for each individual with their own interests.
					<br>With Groep-één, I hope to provide the best university experience for students.

					Hey! I’m Annebelle, I study Psychology & Technology, and I am a former board member of COSMOS. As an international student, one thing that is very important to me at TU/e is inclusion. This is something that Groep-één takes great consideration into, with events and initiatives that bring the campus associations together to further improve inclusiveness on campus, next to the input the fraction gives on behalf of international students in University Council meetings. Because of this, I find Groep-één to be an important body on campus which is why I have been an active member in the core group and have encouraged others to stay up to date with decisions the fraction makes in UC meetings.

					<h2>Inclusivity</h2>
					<p>
						This year, Groep-één managed to officially get a TU/e employee appointed to work on diversity for students. This employee is working on getting the university more inclusive by making new proposals and providing help to the university itself, but also to students and associations.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="achievementsSection">
				<div class="achievementsText">
					<h2>Student Well-being</h2>
					<p>
						Last year, Groep-één has been busy in setting up a university-wide network of all parties in our university that were busy on this topic. Together they are sharing experiences and ideas and working together on improving our students’ well-being.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="achievementsSection">
				<div class="achievementsText large">
					<h2>Personal Development</h2>
					<p>
						This year, we all had to cope with the COVID-19 crisis and we noticed in some cases a board year caused more time, stress or work. Giving them more stress around fulfilling the requirements for a board grant would have been unfair and undesired. Therefore we ensured a relaxation of these requirement to help them and keep them motivated for their board year.
					<br><br>Next to that, we also pushed for abolishing the entrance requirements for a board grant. After a second legal case this year, the university changed its policy. Before, you had to have your Propaedeutic exam and you should have had obtained 75% of your nominal study pace. These rules are not in place anymore.
					<br><br>This year, career orientation and development was officially included in the program.	
				</p>

				<div class="achievementsText">
					<h2>Quality of Education</h2>
					<p>
						Due to corona, the engagement of students was under attack in the fast developing change of education. Groep-één has worked very hard to keep the student engagement as close to what it normally is. Critical but constructive feedback on proposals helped our education remain high in quality.	
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="achievementsSection">
				<div class="achievementsText">
					<h2>Community</h2>
					<p>
						Groep-één has tried to raise as much attention as possible for this community building. From our small contribution at the TU/e Radio, towards a TU/e Summer University and towards participation in the design of the onboarding of new students as well as the student mentors for master students who were new at this university. We stressed the importance of community life by speaking up and acting on it!
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="achievementsSection">
				<div class="achievementsText">
					<h2>Facilities</h2>
					<p>
						We have pushed for extra financial support for students, associations and student teams. Examples like the career expo that was cancelled during the first day, study trips that got cancelled, Student teams that had a hard time finding new members, international students that had no financial income anymore and no way of getting any DUO loans, or students that were experiencing expensive delay in their program because of the crisis. We have pushed for attention on these cases and a proper plan and in the meantime, a lot of compensations have been drawn up!

				<div class="goalsText">
					<h2>Inclusivity</h2>
					<p>
						Next year, we also want to improve on a better admission policy for internationalization. All students should be our priority and we believe the university should think of a proper policy to have a fair admission process.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="goalsSection">
				<div class="goalsText">
					<h2>Student Well-being</h2>
					<p>
						Next year, we also want to tackle the undiscovered well-being issues at our student community. We are working with the university on a proposal to have an employee dedicated to structural wellbeing issues. The pressure on students and the need for personal attention is high and we want students to excel in this university in a safe and healthy way.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="goalsSection">
				<div class="goalsText">
					<h2>Personal Development</h2>
					<p>
						In the upcoming year, we want more money to be available for board members and student team members, as currently there is not enough money to give everyone the compensation that was meant for them.
						<br><br>Next year, we want to get more recognition and support for extra-curricular activitiesin general. There are plenty of things you could do next to your courses, but we encourage good guidance along these activities. This can be done e.g. via personal and/or digital coaching.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="goalsSection">
				<div class="goalsText">
					<h2>Quality of Education</h2>
					<p>
						As our university is growing, we need to focus on how to maintain, or restore the personal aspect in your courses. But also during your graduation phase of the bachelor and master. There should be time for you to excel, and that needs good coaching from the moment you step in this university, until the moment you graduate.
						<br><br>Next year, Groep-één will again be working hard on the best allocation of the Dutch ‘basic grant’ (basisbeurs) for our students. It is ‘our’ money, so it should go to good quality of education for our students.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="goalsSection">
				<div class="goalsText">
					<h2>Sustainability</h2>
					<p>
						Groep-één is in close contact with parties that work on sustainability on our campus. By close cooperation, we want to get a university wide mindset on the importance of sustainability.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="goalsSection">
				<div class="goalsText">
					<h2>Community</h2>
					<p>
						For the upcoming year, we want to continue working on community life, and in particular on the accessibility of our campus and the community. There should be sufficient facilities for all associations and teams to contribute to this community building and we will stand up for that.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="goalsSection">
				<div class="goalsText">
					<h2>Facilities</h2>
					<p>
						Groep-één wants to also work on the availability of facilities outside of corona. For the quality of our education, it is important to have access to the software we need to study. For materials the same should hold. It is undesired to have students pay a lot of money for the top shelf software they need, or to have them using alternative software that doesn’t provide the needed skill and knowledge on the software you will use later on.
